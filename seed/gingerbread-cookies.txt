= Gingerbread Cookies

# In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves.

- 440 grams All-Purpose Flour
- 1 teaspoon Baking Soda
- 1/2 teaspoon Table Salt
- 1 tablespoon Ground Ginger
- 1 tablespoon Cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon Ground Allspice
- 1/2 teaspoon Ground Cloves

# In a separate large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add brown sugar and molasses, beating on medium-high speed until well combined and creamy, scraping bowl as needed.

- 145 grams Unsalted Butter
- 150 grams Brown Sugar
- 200 grams Molasses

# Beat in egg and vanilla on high speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl as needed. Don't worry if the mixture looks slightly separated.

- 1 each Eggs
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract

# Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and beat on low speed until combined. Dough will be thick and slightly sticky.

# Divide dough in half. Shape each half into a disc and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 3 days.

# Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

# Working with one disc at a time, roll dough on a generously floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. If dough cracks, let it warm slightly and use fingers to press cracks together. Cut into desired shapes and place 1 inch apart on prepared sheets.

# Bake for 9-10 minutes for 4-inch cookies, 8 minutes for smaller cookies, or 11 minutes for larger cookies. Rotate pans halfway through baking.

# Let cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.

# Decorate cooled cookies with icing if desired.
