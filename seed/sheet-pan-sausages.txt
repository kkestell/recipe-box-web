= Sheet-Pan Sausages

# Heat oven to 450Â°F.

# Score sausages in a few places on both sides, making sure not to cut all the way through. Toss sausages and mushrooms on a sheet pan with olive oil, salt and pepper. Spread in an even layer and roast, shaking the pan once or twice, until browned and cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.

- 1 lb Italian sausages, hot or sweet
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 lb mixed mushrooms, trimmed and quartered

# Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine olive oil, vinegar, and garlic; season to taste with salt and pepper.

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 garlic clove, coarsely chopped
- Kosher salt, to taste
- Black pepper, to taste

# When sausages and mushrooms are done, use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer to a plate, leaving the drippings behind. Add the torn bread and 1 teaspoon of the dressing to the baking sheet. If bread seems dry, add more dressing, 1 teaspoon at a time. Roast until bread is lightly toasted, 5 to 10 minutes.

- 4 cups crusty bread, torn into bite-size pieces

# Add mushrooms and arugula to the pan. Drizzle and toss with the remaining vinaigrette until lightly coated. Stir in the parsley, then season to taste with salt, pepper, oil and vinegar. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve with the sausages.

- 2 cups arugula
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, coarsely chopped
- Parmesan cheese, finely grated
