# Add Pecorino Romano, salt, and Italian seasoning to the panade, stirring to combine.

- 1/4 cup pecorino romano cheese
- 1 teaspoon table salt

# Add sausage and ground beef to the bowl. Mix gently with your hands just until ingredients are evenly combined. Do not overmix.

- 1 pound italian sausage
- 1-1 1/2 pounds ground beef

# Heat oven to 375Â°F. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet.

# Form mixture into meatballs of desired size (about 2 tablespoons each), being careful not to pack too tightly.

# Arrange meatballs on the prepared rack, leaving space between each.

# Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until meatballs are golden brown and cooked through.
