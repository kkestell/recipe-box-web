= Pita Bread

+ Making the Starter

# Put lukewarm water in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add yeast and sugar. Stir to dissolve with a wooden spoon.

- 470 milliliters (2 cups) water
- 4 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon sugar

# Add the whole-wheat and all-purpose flour. Mix with a wooden spoon until combined.

- 100 grams (1 cup) whole-wheat flour
- 100 grams (3/4 cup) all-purpose flour

# Put bowl in a warm (not hot) place, uncovered, until mixture is frothy and bubbling, about 15 minutes.

+ Making the Dough

# Add salt, olive oil, and all-purpose flour.

- 2 teaspoons Kosher salt
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 500 grams (4 1/8 cups) all-purpose flour

# With a wooden spoon, stir until the mixture forms a shaggy mass. Attach the dough hook.

# Knead with the dough hook on medium-low speed (Speed 2 on a KitchenAid) for 3-4 minutes until the dough is just smooth and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Be careful not to over-knead - we want tender pita, not chewy bread. The dough should be soft and slightly tacky but not sticky. Add minimal additional flour if needed.

# Optionally, refrigerate for several hours or overnight if needed. When ready to use, bring dough back to room temperature, knead into a ball, and proceed with recipe.

+ Fermentation

# Place the dough into a lightly oiled bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap and a towel. Place in a warm (not hot) place.

# Place a heavy-duty baking sheet, cast-iron pan, or pizza stone on the lowest rack position and heat the oven to 475Â°F.

# Let the dough double in size, about 1 hour.

+ Baking the Pita

# Punch down the dough and divide into 16 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, cover with a damp towel, and let rest for 10 minutes.

# Roll each dough ball into an 8" circle, about 1/8 inch thick, dusting with flour as needed.

# Place the dough circle onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake for 2 minutes until puffed, then turn over and bake for 1 more minute. Transfer warm pita to a napkin-lined basket and cover to keep soft. Repeat with the remaining dough.
