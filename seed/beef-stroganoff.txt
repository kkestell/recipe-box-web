= Beef Stroganoff

# Place a large deep pan or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add oil and once very hot, add thinly sliced beef strips in a single layer, cooking 1 minute per side without stirring. Cook until just browned and no longer red. Sear beef in 2 batches to avoid overcrowding. Remove beef to a plate and cover to keep warm.

- 1 pound Top Sirloin Steak, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons Avocado Oil

# Reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter and onion. Cook for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and just beginning to caramelize to a light golden brown.

- 2 tablespoons Unsalted Butter
- 1 each Onion, diced

# Increase heat to medium-high. Add mushrooms and cook for 6-8 minutes until liquid has evaporated and mushrooms are lightly browned.

- 1/2 pound Mushrooms

# Add garlic and sautee 1 minute until fragrant. Add cognac and let simmer until almost completely evaporated, about 2-3 minutes, while scraping up all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Once the pan is nearly dry, add flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to make a roux with the remaining butter and fat in the pan.

- 1 clove Garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup Cognac
- 1 tablespoon All-Purpose Flour

# Pour in beef broth, scraping any remaining bits from the bottom of the pan then add whipping cream and simmer another 1 to 2 minutes or until slightly thickened.

- 1 cup Beef Broth
- 3/4 cup Heavy Whipping Cream

# Stir a few tablespoons of the sauce into sour cream to temper it so it doesn't curdle then add it to the pan while stirring constantly. Stir in Worcestershire, dijon mustard, and season with salt and pepper, or season to taste and continue simmering until sauce is creamy.

- 1/4 cup Sour Cream
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon Dijon Mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt
- 1/4 teaspoon Black Pepper

# Add beef with any accumulated juices back to the pan and bring just to a simmer or until beef is heated through. Serve over egg noodles and garnish with parsley.

- 8-12 ounces Egg Noodles
- 1 tablespoon Italian Parsley
