= Angel Food Cake

# Adjust the oven rack to the lower middle position and preheat oven to 325Â°F.

# In a food processor or blender, pulse the sugar until fine and powdery. Remove 200 grams and set aside to use later. Add cake flour and salt to the food processor. Pulse 5-10 times until the mixture is aerated and light.

- 350 grams Granulated Sugar
- 133 grams Cake Flour
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt

# In a large bowl, whip egg whites and cream of tartar together on medium-low until foamy, about 1 minute.

- 12 each Egg Whites
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Cream of Tartar

# Switch to medium-high and slowly add the 1 cup of sugar set aside earlier. Whip until soft peaks form, about 5-6 minutes.

- 200 grams Granulated Sugar

# Add vanilla extract, then beat just until incorporated.

- 1 1/2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract

# In 3 additions, slowly sift the flour mixture into the egg white mixture using a fine mesh strainer, gently folding with a rubber spatula after each addition. Do not add all at once to avoid deflating the batter.

# Pour and spread the batter into an ungreased 9 or 10-inch tube pan. Shimmy the pan on the counter to smooth the surface.

# Bake the cake until a toothpick inserted comes out clean, about 40-45 minutes. Rotate the pan halfway through baking.

# Remove from the oven, then cool completely upside-down on a wire rack for about 3 hours.

# Once cooled, run a thin knife around the edges and gently tap the pan on the counter until the cake releases.

# If desired, dust with confectioners' sugar. Slice with a sharp serrated knife. Serve with whipped cream and fresh berries.
