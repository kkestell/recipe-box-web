= Homemade Soft Breadsticks

+ Ingredients

# Gather the following ingredients:

- 1 1/4 cups (300 milliliters) warm water
- 1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) instant or active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons (43 grams) unsalted butter, melted
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 3 1/3 cups (433 grams) bread flour
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

+ Instructions

# Add warm water, yeast, and sugar to bread machine pan. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.

# Add melted butter, salt, bread flour (all at once), and garlic powder (if using) to the bread machine pan.

# Set bread machine to "dough" cycle and start. The machine will mix and knead the dough, then allow for the first rise.

# When dough cycle is complete, remove dough from machine and punch down to release air.

# Divide the dough in half, then cut each half into 7 equal pieces (about 55g each).

# Roll each piece into a log about 8 inches long and arrange on two parchment-lined baking sheets, 7 per sheet.

# Cover shaped breadsticks and allow to rise until slightly puffy, about 20 minutes.

# Preheat oven to 400 degF.

# Bake breadsticks for 18-19 minutes or until golden brown, rotating pans halfway through.

# While baking, melt butter and stir in salt and garlic powder.

# Remove breadsticks from oven, brush with garlic butter mixture, and let cool for a few minutes before serving.

# Store leftover breadsticks in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 day or refrigerated for up to 5 days.
