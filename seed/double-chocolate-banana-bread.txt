= Double Chocolate Banana Bread

# Preheat oven to 350 °F. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Set aside.

# In a large bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together until combined. Mix in chocolate chips. Set aside.

- 1 1/4 cups (156 grams) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
- 1/2 cup (41 grams) unsweetened natural cocoa powder (not Dutch process)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup (135 grams) semi-sweet chocolate chips

# Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. With the mixer running on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract until combined. Add the dry ingredients and hot water, and beat on low speed until combined. Batter is thick. Do not over-mix.

- 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons; 113 grams) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1/4 cup (60 grams) plain yogurt or sour cream, at room temperature
- 1 1/2 cups (345 grams) mashed bananas (about 4 medium or 3 large ripe bananas)
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon espresso powder
- 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) hot water

# Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle remaining chocolate chips on top, down the center of the loaf.

- 2 tablespoons semi-sweet chocolate chips

# Bake for 60–65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from drying out. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. This may be after 60–65 minutes depending on your oven, so begin checking around the 60-minute mark, at 5-minute intervals.

# Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan set on a wire rack for at least 1 to 2 hours before removing, slicing, and serving.

# Cover and store bread at room temperature for 5 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Banana bread tastes best on day 2 after the flavors have settled together.
