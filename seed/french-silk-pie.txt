# Pour the heavy cream into a large mixing bowl and whip on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue to whip until stiff peaks form, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the whipped cream to a small bowl and refrigerate until needed.

- 1 cup Heavy Cream

# Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on 50% power in 30-second increments, stirring after each, until completely melted and smooth. Set aside.

- 8 ounces Bittersweet Chocolate

# In a large, heatproof bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar and water. Beat the mixture on medium speed until pale yellow and thick, about 5 minutes.

# Set the bowl over a medium saucepan filled ~Â½-inch of barely simmering water over low heat, and warm the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it reaches 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the bowl from the heat and beat the mixture on medium speed until it is light and fluffy and cooled to room temperature, about 8 minutes.

# Add the melted chocolate and vanilla extract to the cooled egg mixture and beat until incorporated.

- 1 tablespoon Vanilla Extract

# Beat in the butter, a few pieces at a time, until well combined.
