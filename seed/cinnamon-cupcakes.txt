= Cinnamon Cupcakes

+ Cupcakes

# Heat oven to 350Â°F. Line a standard muffin tin with 12 paper liners.

# In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside.

- 210 grams (1 2/3 cups) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

# In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter and sugar until combined (mixture will be gritty). Whisk in the egg, sour cream, milk, and vanilla extract until combined.

- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
- 200 grams (1 cup) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg, room temperature
- 60 grams (1/4 cup) sour cream or plain yogurt, room temperature
- 180 grams (3/4 cup) whole milk, room temperature
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract

# Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until the batter is completely combined. Batter should be creamy and mostly smooth; a few small lumps are OK.

# In a small bowl, mix together the remaining sugar and cinnamon. Set aside.

- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

# Spoon 2 scant tablespoons of cupcake batter into each cupcake liner. Top with 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Top with 1 heaping tablespoon of cupcake batter, until the cupcake liners are about 3/4 full.

# Top each cupcake with 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon-sugar. Swirl each gently with a toothpick.

# Bake for 20-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

# Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely. Shake off any excess cinnamon-sugar that isn't sticking to the tops before frosting.

+ Frosting

- 125 grams (1 cup) confectioners' sugar
