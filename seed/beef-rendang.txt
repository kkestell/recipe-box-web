= Beef Rendang

# Place chilies, onion, garlic, sliced lemongrass, galangal, and ginger in a small food processor and whizz until fine. (If using dried chilies and the processor isn't powerful, chop chilies first).

- 12 each dried chilies, rehydrated, or large fresh chilies
- 1 each small onion, finely chopped
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 stalks lemongrass, white part only, sliced
- 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh galangal, finely chopped
- 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh ginger, minced

# Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large heavy-based pot over high heat. Add half the beef and brown well, then remove onto a plate. Repeat with remaining beef.

- 1 tablespoon oil
- 2 pounds chuck steak, cut into 1 5/8" cubes

# Lower heat to medium-low. Add 2 tbsp oil and the prepared Spice Paste to the pot. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring, until fragrant, moisture reduces, and the paste darkens slightly.

- 2 tablespoons oil

# Add the cinnamon stick, clove powder, star anise, cardamom powder, smashed lemongrass stick, coconut milk, tamarind puree, kaffir lime leaves, desiccated coconut, brown sugar, salt, and the browned beef (with any juices) back to the pot. Stir everything to combine well.

- 1 each cinnamon stick
- 1/4 teaspoon clove powder
- 3 each star anise
- 1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
- 1 stick lemongrass, bottom half only, smashed
- 1 can (14 ounce) coconut milk
- 2 teaspoons tamarind puree
- 4 each large kaffir lime leaves, very finely sliced
- 1/3 cup desiccated coconut
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt

# Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, then immediately turn down the heat to low or medium-low so the sauce is bubbling very gently, not rapidly boiling.

# Put the lid on the pot and leave it to simmer for 1 hour 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.

# Remove the lid and check the beef's tenderness with a fork. It should be quite tender but not yet completely falling apart. (If it's already falling apart, carefully remove the beef pieces before proceeding).

# Turn up the heat to medium. Continue to simmer with the lid off for 30-40 minutes. Stir occasionally at first, then more frequently towards the end as the sauce thickens, until it reduces to a dark, thick paste that coats the beef and the oil starts to separate. The beef should brown further during this stage.

# The beef should now be extremely tender. If it's not quite there, add a small splash of water and continue cooking gently for a few more minutes. Remove from heat. Serve the Beef Rendang hot, traditionally accompanied by plain or coconut rice.
