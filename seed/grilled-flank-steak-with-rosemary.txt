= Grilled Flank Steak with Rosemary

# In a 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish, mix the soy sauce, olive oil, honey, garlic, rosemary, and black pepper.

- 1/2 cup Soy Sauce
- 1/2 cup Olive Oil
- 4 1/2 tablespoons Honey
- 6 each Garlic
- 3 tablespoons Rosemary
- 1 1/2 tablespoons Black Pepper

# Add the flank steak to the dish and turn to coat it evenly with the marinade.

- 2-2 1/2 pounds Flank Steak

# Cover the dish and refrigerate for 2 hours, turning the steak occasionally.

# Prepare a grill (medium-high heat) or preheat the broiler.

# Remove the steak from the marinade and discard the marinade.

# Grill the steak to the desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.

# Transfer the steak to a work surface and let it stand for 5 minutes.

# Cut the steak across the grain into thin strips (cutting against the grain ensures tenderness).

# Arrange the strips on a platter and serve immediately.
