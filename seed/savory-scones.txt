= Savory Scones

# Heat oven to 400°F and position rack in middle-low position. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.

# In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder.

- 240 grams (2 cups) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon table salt
- 1 tablespoon baking powder

# Grate the frozen butter into the dry ingredients, then cut it in with a pastry cutter until the mixture is crumbly. Gently stir in the cheese cubes and chopped scallions. Place the bowl in the freezer to chill.

- 113 grams (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter
- 113 grams (1 cup) sharp cheddar cheese
- 3 scallions, sliced

# In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk or cream, and Dijon mustard (if using) until well combined. Place in the freezer.

- 2 large eggs
- 75 grams (1/3 cup) milk
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

# After chilling for 15 minutes, remove both bowls from the freezer. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix just until no dry flour remains. Do not overmix.

# Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Working quickly, gather the dough together and press into a cohesive mass.

# Pat or roll the dough into a 2"×10" rectangle.

# Using a sharp knife, cut the rectangle into 5 equal squares, then cut each square diagonally to create 10 triangles.

# Place the triangles on a plate or baking sheet, then refrigerate for 15-30 minutes.

# When ready to bake, transfer the chilled scones to the prepared pan, spacing them 2-3 inches apart. Brush the tops with additional cream if desired.

# Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until edges are golden brown and top is light brown.

# Let cool on pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool slightly. Best served warm.
