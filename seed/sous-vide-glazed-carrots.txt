= Sous Vide Glazed Carrots

# Preheat a water bath to 183°F (84°C) using a sous vide immersion circulator.

# Place carrots, butter, sugar, and kosher salt in a vacuum bag and seal according to the manufacturer's instructions.

- 1 pound Baby Carrots
- 2 tablespoons Unsalted Butter
- 1 tablespoon Granulated Sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon Kosher Salt

# Cook the vacuum-sealed bag in the water bath for about 1 hour, until the carrots are fully tender. Refrigerate if not using immediately.

# Empty the entire contents of the bag into a 12-inch, heavy-bottomed skillet. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until the liquid reduces to a shiny glaze, about 2 minutes. If the glaze breaks and turns greasy, add water a teaspoon at a time, shaking the pan to re-form the glaze.

# Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper, stir in parsley if desired, and serve.
