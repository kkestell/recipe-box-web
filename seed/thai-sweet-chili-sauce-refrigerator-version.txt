= Thai Sweet Chili Sauce (Refrigerator Version)

# Seed and chop bell peppers. Chop Thai chilies. Shred carrot using the second-finest holes of a box grater and then roughly chop. Mince garlic.

- 3-5 each Thai Chilies
- 325 grams Red Bell Peppers
- 1/4 cup Grated Carrot
- 6 cloves Garlic

# In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 2 cups water with the vinegars, sugar, and salt. Stir until sugar and salt dissolve completely. To prevent garlic from turning blue, use only pure, non-iodized salt like kosher or pickling salt. Avoid using chlorinated tap water; filtered or distilled water works best. Fresh, young garlic is also less likely to discolor than older garlic.

- 2 cups Filtered or Distilled Water
- 1 cup Rice Vinegar
- 1 cup Cider Vinegar
- 400 grams Granulated Sugar
- 18 grams Kosher or Pickling Salt

# Add the prepared chilies, bell peppers, carrot, and garlic. Bring mixture to a boil and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

# In a separate bowl, whisk the cornstarch with water until smooth. While stirring the sauce vigorously, pour this slurry into the boiling mixture in a steady stream.

- 55 grams Cornstarch
- 1/3 cup Water

# Continue stirring constantly and return mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 minute, or until thickened.

# Allow sauce to cool to room temperature. Transfer to clean jars or containers with tight-fitting lids.

# Refrigerate and use within 2-3 weeks.
