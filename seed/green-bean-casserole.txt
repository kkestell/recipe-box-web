= Green Bean Casserole

# Trim and cut the fresh green beans into 1 to 1 1/2-inch pieces. Rinse thoroughly under cold water.

- 8 cups Fresh Green Beans

# Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and blanch for 5 minutes. Immediately transfer them to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Drain and set aside.

- Water
- 1 tablespoon Table Salt

# In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk, soy sauce, minced garlic, and ground black pepper. Mix until well combined.

- 2 can Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup
- 1/3 cup Milk
- 1 teaspoon Soy Sauce
- 1 clove Garlic
- 1/4 teaspoon Ground Black Pepper

# Add the blanched green beans and 1 1/3 cups of the french fried onions to the bowl. Mix gently to coat the green beans evenly.

- 1 1/3 cups French Fried Onions

# Transfer the mixture to an oven-safe container, cover tightly with foil, and refrigerate until ready to bake.

# When ready to bake, let the casserole come to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake for 20 minutes, then stir the mixture.

# Uncover the casserole and top with 1/2 cup shredded cheese and the remaining french fried onions. Bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the onions are golden.
