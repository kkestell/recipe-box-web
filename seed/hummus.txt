# Place the chickpeas in a medium saucepan and add the baking soda. Cover the chickpeas by several inches of water, then bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat as necessary to prevent overflow and continue boiling for about 20 minutes, until the chickpeas look bloated, their skins are falling off, and they are very soft. Drain in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cool water for about 30 seconds. Set aside.

- 1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

# In a food processor or high-powered blender, combine the lemon juice, garlic, and salt. Process until the garlic is very finely chopped. Let rest for at least 10 minutes.

- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
- 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt

# Add the tahini and blend until thick and creamy, scraping down the sides as needed.

- 3/4 cup tahini

# While running the processor, drizzle in 6 tablespoons of ice water. Scrape down the sides and blend until the mixture is smooth and pale. If the tahini is extra thick, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of ice water.

- 6 tablespoons ice water

# Add the cumin and the drained chickpeas. While blending, drizzle in the olive oil. Blend until super smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down as necessary. Add more ice water if needed for a creamy texture.

- 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

# Taste and adjust seasoning. Add additional salt or lemon juice to taste.

# Scrape into a serving bowl, create swirls on top, and garnish as desired.

- Olive oil
- Sumac or paprika
- Chopped fresh parsley

# Store covered in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
