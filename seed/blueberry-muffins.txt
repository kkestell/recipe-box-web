= Blueberry Muffins

# Heat oven to 400Â°F. Line a standard muffin tin with 9 paper liners.

# In a large bowl, sift together the flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

- 180 grams all-purpose flour
- 150 grams granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt

# In a 2-cup measuring cup, combine the oil, egg, and vanilla extract. Whisk until thoroughly blended, then add enough milk to bring the total liquid volume to the 1-cup mark. Whisk again until well combined.

- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup whole milk

# Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the wet ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula just until no dry flour remains. The batter will be very thick; do not overmix.

# Gently fold the blueberries into the batter until evenly distributed.

- 1 cup fresh blueberries

# Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each to the top. The cups will be very full.

# Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and tops are golden brown.

# Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.
