= Pumpkin Muffins

# Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.

# In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, ginger, and salt until well combined.

- 220 grams all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon table salt

# In a medium bowl, whisk together the oil, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until combined. Add pumpkin puree, eggs, and milk, whisking until smooth.

- 120 milliliters vegetable oil
- 100 grams granulated sugar
- 100 grams brown sugar
- 340 grams pumpkin puree
- 2 large eggs
- 60 milliliters milk

# Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the wet ingredients and fold together gently with a rubber spatula just until no dry flour remains. Do not overmix.

# Divide batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each to the top.

# Bake at 425°F for 5 minutes, then, without opening the oven door, reduce temperature to 350°F. Continue baking for 16-17 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.

# Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.
