= Chicken and Apricot Tagine

# Create saffron infusion by placing two ice cubes in a small bowl. Sprinkle ground saffron over the ice and allow to melt at room temperature. Reserve.

- 2 ice cubes
- 1/4 teaspoon ground saffron

# Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add avocado oil. Working in batches if necessary, sear chicken thighs skin-side down until golden brown, 8-12 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and reserve.

- 2 tablespoons avocado oil
- 3-4 chicken thighs

# In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium-low. Add diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelization begins, approximately 45 minutes.

- 1 yellow onion, diced

# Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, approximately 1 minute. Incorporate ground spices and salt, continuing to cook until spices are toasted and aromatic.

- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon, freshly ground
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon Kosher salt

# Return chicken and accumulated juices to the skillet. Tie cilantro and parsley into a bouquet garni with kitchen twine and add to pan along with green olives, chicken stock, and saffron water. Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes.

- Seared chicken thighs
- 5 sprigs cilantro
- 5 sprigs parsley
- 75 grams (1/2 cup) green olives, pitted
- 120 grams (1/2 cup) chicken stock

# While the chicken simmers, combine dried apricots, water, honey, and cinnamon stick in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook until apricots are tender and liquid has reduced to a glaze, 10-15 minutes.

- 80 grams (1/2 cup) dried apricots, halved
- 240 grams (1 cup) water
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 cinnamon stick

# Simultaneously, toast sliced almonds in a 350Â°F oven until golden brown and fragrant, approximately 5 minutes. Reserve.

# Add the apricot glaze mixture to the chicken during the final 10 minutes of cooking.

# Remove bouquet garni and cinnamon stick. Serve hot over couscous, garnished with toasted almonds.
