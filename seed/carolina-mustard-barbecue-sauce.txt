= Carolina Mustard Barbecue Sauce

# Tomato- or ketchup-based barbecue sauces rule most parts of the country. But in the southern part of North Carolina (and in a few parts of South Carolina and Florida), barbecue simply isn't barbecue unless it's served with a bright yellow sauce made from mustard, honey, and vinegar. If you haven't grown up with such a sauce, the very notion might seem off-putting. But even if you come from tomato sauce country, mustard barbecue sauce quickly becomes addictive.

# Tradition calls for using inexpensive ballpark-style mustard and you'll certainly be in good company if you use this kind of mustard. But I like the sharper, more refined flavor of Dijon mustard—particularly an "old-fashioned style" mustard imported from France. Look for the words à l'ancienne on the label.

# Combine the mustard, honey, brown sugar, and vinegar in a nonreactive saucepan and whisk to mix.

- 1/2 cup prepared mustard of your choice
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
- 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar, or more to taste

# Bring to a simmer over low heat and cook gently, uncovered, until richly flavored, about 5 minutes, whisking from time to time.

# Remove from the heat and taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste and more vinegar as necessary.

- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

# Transfer the sauce to a serving bowl and serve warm or at room temperature. The sauce will keep, tightly covered in the refrigerator, for several weeks.
