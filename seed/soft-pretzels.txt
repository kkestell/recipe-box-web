= Soft Pretzels

# Whisk the yeast into warm water. Allow to sit for 1 minute. Whisk in salt, sugar, and melted butter.

- 1 1/2 cups warm water
- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon table salt
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar or granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

# Gradually add 3 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing with a wooden spoon or dough hook. Add 3/4 cup more flour until the dough is no longer sticky. Add additional flour, 1/4–1/2 cup at a time, if necessary. The dough is ready to knead when it bounces back when poked.

- 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

# Knead the dough for 5 minutes by hand or in the mixer until it passes the windowpane test. Shape into a ball, cover with a towel, and rest for 10 minutes.

# Preheat oven to 400 °F and line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or greased parchment paper.

# Cut dough into 1/3-cup sections (about 75 grams each). Roll each piece into a 20–22-inch rope and shape into pretzels.

# Bring baking soda and 9 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Drop 1–2 pretzels into the boiling water for 20–30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spatula, let excess water drip off, and place on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with coarse salt.

- 1/2 cup baking soda
- 9 cups water
- Coarse salt

# Bake pretzels for 12–15 minutes or until golden brown.
