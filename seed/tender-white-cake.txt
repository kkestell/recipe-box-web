= Tender White Cake

# Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Prepare two 8" x 2" or 9" x 2" round pans; a 9" x 13" pan; or 2 standard cupcake pans by greasing and flouring; or lining with parchment, then greasing the parchment. Note: Make sure your 8" round pans are at least 2" deep.

# Mix all of the dry ingredients on slow speed to blend. Add the soft butter and mix until evenly crumbly, like fine damp sand. It may form a paste, depending on the temperature of the butter, how much it's mixed, and granulation of the sugar used.

- 330 grams Cake Flour
- 530 grams Granulated Sugar
- 1 tablespoon Baking Powder
- 3/4 teaspoon Table Salt
- 12 tablespoons Unsalted Butter

# Add the egg whites one at a time, then the whole egg, beating well after each addition to begin building the structure of the cake. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl after each addition.

- 4 each Egg Whites
- 1 each Egg

# In a small bowl, whisk the yogurt (or milk) with the vanilla and almond extracts. Add this mixture, 1/3 at a time, to the batter. Beat 1 to 2 minutes after each addition, until fluffy. Be sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.

- 1 cup Full-Fat Vanilla Yogurt
- 2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract
- 1 teaspoon Almond Extract

# Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes for 8" or 9" rounds; 23 to 26 minutes for a 9" x 13" x 2" sheet cake; or 20 minutes for cupcakes.
