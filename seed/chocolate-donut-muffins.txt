= Chocolate Donut Muffins

# Heat oven to 375Â°F with rack set in center. Generously butter a 12-cup muffin tin.

# In a large bowl, combine eggs and sugar and whisk until well combined. Add sour cream, butter, oil, nutmeg and salt; whisk until well combined.

- 2 each Eggs
- 3/4 cup Granulated Sugar
- 1 cup Sour Cream
- 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Nutmeg, freshly grated
- 1 1/8 teaspoons Kosher Salt

# Whisk in cocoa powder, followed by baking powder and baking soda. Then fold in flour until just incorporated.

- 45 grams Dutch-Process Cocoa Powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Baking Powder
- 1/4 teaspoon Baking Soda
- 128 grams All-Purpose Flour

# Divide mixture among the 12 wells and bake until muffins are puffed and toothpick inserted in center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 18 to 23 minutes.

# While the muffins bake, combine remaining sugar, cinnamon and salt in a shallow bowl.

- 1/4 cup Granulated Sugar
- 1 tablespoon Ground Cinnamon
- 1 pinch Kosher Salt

# Let muffins cool in pan for 5 minutes then transfer to a rack. Working with one warm muffin at a time, brush with melted butter then toss in cinnamon sugar; repeat with remaining muffins.

# Store any extras in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days. The sugar will gradually melt into the muffins as they sit, but you can reroll the muffins in cinnamon sugar, if desired.
