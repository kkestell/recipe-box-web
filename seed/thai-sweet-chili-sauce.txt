= Thai Sweet Chili Sauce

# Seed and roughly chop bell peppers. Chop Thai chilies. Shred carrot using the second-finest holes of a box grater. Mince garlic.

- 6-10 each Thai Chilies
- 650 grams Red Bell Peppers
- 1/2 cup Carrots
- 12 cloves Garlic

# In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 4 cups water with the vinegars, sugar, and salt. Stir until sugar and salt dissolve completely.

- 4 cups Water
- 2 cups Rice Vinegar
- 2 cups Cider Vinegar
- 800 grams Granulated Sugar
- 35 grams Kosher Salt

# Add the prepared chilies, bell peppers, carrot, and garlic. Bring mixture to a boil and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

# In a separate bowl, whisk the Clear Jel with remaining 2/3 cup water until smooth. While stirring the sauce vigorously, pour this slurry into the boiling mixture in a steady stream.

- 110 grams Modified Cornstarch
- 4 cups Water

# Continue stirring constantly and return mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 minute, or until thickened.

# Ladle hot sauce into clean, hot half-pint jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Remove air bubbles using a chopstick or bubble tool. Adjust headspace with additional hot sauce if needed.

# Wipe jar rims clean with a paper towel dipped in vinegar. Center lids on jars and apply rings until fingertip-tight.

# Process in a boiling water bath, ensuring jars are covered by 2 inches of water. Process for 10 minutes with lid on.

# Remove jars and let cool undisturbed for 12-24 hours.
