= Bagels

+ Starter

# In a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together the starter ingredients to make a shaggy dough, then use your hand to knead gently until thoroughly combined. (This may take about a minute; it's quite stiff.) Cover the bowl and let the starter rest at room temperature for 4 to 14 hours; it should expand.

- 1 cup bread flour
- 1/8 teaspoon table salt
- 1/16 teaspoon instant yeast
- 1/3 cup water

+ Dough Preparation

# Add the remaining dough ingredients in the order listed to the bowl with the starter. Mix to bring the dough together, by hand or at low speed of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. Next, knead the stiff dough until it’s supple and elastic. This will take up to 15 minutes by hand or 8 to 10 minutes at medium-low speed with a mixer.

- 1/3 cup water
- 2 teaspoons non-diastatic malt powder
- 1/16 teaspoon instant yeast
- 1/8 teaspoon table salt
- 1 cup bread flour

# Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and let it rest, covered with a reusable cover or plastic wrap, until it doubles in bulk. This will take about 2 to 2 1/2 hours depending on the warmth of your kitchen.

+ Shaping

# Turn the dough out onto a clean surface, gently deflate it, and divide it into eight equal pieces (80g to 85g each).

# Working with one piece of dough at a time, fold the edges into the center. Pinch to seal and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.

# Starting with the first piece of dough you shaped, place it seam-side down on an unfloured surface. Use your cupped fingers and palm to roll the dough into a tight ball, moving your hand in a circular motion. The dough should stick slightly to the surface in order to create tension to yield a smooth exterior. If the dough is unmanageably sticky, add a very light dusting of flour; if the dough slides around on the surface without tightening, use a damp towel to clean and moisten the surface and try again.

# Once shaped into a tight ball, place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.

# Cover the pre-shaped dough and allow it to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.

# Line a baking sheet with parchment and lightly grease the parchment; or sprinkle the parchment lightly with cornmeal, semolina, or farina, to prevent the bagels from sticking.

# Working with one piece of dough at a time, use your finger to poke a hole through the center. Gently rotate the dough to expand the hole to 2” to 3” in diameter, forming a ring shape. Place the shaped bagel onto the prepared baking sheet. The hole will close up a bit; that’s OK.

# Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Place the bagels on the baking sheet in a 3-2-3 arrangement to allow them to fit nicely on one pan.

# Cover the bagels with a reusable cover or lightly greased plastic wrap and let them rest until they feel slightly puffy to the touch, about 30 minutes.

+ Cooking

# While the bagels are resting, preheat the oven to 450°F. Combine the water and malt powder in a wide, shallow pot; the water should be at least 1 1/4" deep. Bring the mixture to a boil.

- 1/3 cup water
- 2 teaspoons non-diastatic malt powder

# Add bagels to the water two or three at a time to avoid crowding. Boil for 60 seconds, then use a dough whisk or slotted spoon to turn the bagels over. Boil for another 60 seconds before removing from the water and placing on the prepared pan.

# If adding a topping, brush each bagel with the egg and water (egg wash) and dip into a bowl of your desired topping before transferring back to the pan.

# Bake the bagels until golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes. Rotate the pan (front to back, back to front) halfway through baking to ensure even browning.
