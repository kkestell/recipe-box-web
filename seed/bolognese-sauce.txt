= Bolognese Sauce

# Put the oil, butter and chopped onion in the pot and turn the heat on to medium. Cook and stir the onion until it has become translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring vegetables to coat them well.

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup chopped onion
- 2/3 cup chopped celery
- 2/3 cup chopped carrot

# Add ground beef, a large pinch of salt, and a few grindings of pepper. Crumble the meat with a fork, stir well and cook until the beef has lost its raw, red color.

- 3/4 pound ground chuck
- Salt
- Black pepper

# Add milk and let it simmer gently, stirring frequently, until it has bubbled away completely. Add nutmeg and stir.

- 1 cup whole milk
- 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg

# Add the wine, let it simmer until it has evaporated, then add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly to coat all ingredients well. When the tomatoes begin to bubble, turn the heat down so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers, with just an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface. Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more, stirring from time to time. While the sauce is cooking, you are likely to find that it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the meat. To keep it from sticking, add 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary. At the end, however, no water at all must be left and the fat must separate from the sauce. Stir to mix the fat into the sauce, taste and correct for salt.

- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 1/2 cups canned imported italian plum tomatoes, cut up, with their juice

# Cook pasta according to box directions.

- 1 1/4-1 1/2 pounds pasta

# Toss sauce with cooked drained pasta and serve with freshly grated Parmesan on the side.

- Freshly grated Parmesan
